# FREQUENCY-SCALAR
FREQUENCY SCALAR FOR THE PERIPHERAL COMMUNICATION
<BR>
AUTHOR- RAVI SHANKAR TIWARI

Dsigned and implemented a parameterized clock divider module with user defined frquency scaling  in the system verilog HDL.This frequency scalar can be used to scale down the high frequency by user defined division factor.The division factor up to the 2^Width is allowed where the width is the parameter defined for the module and user can give the division factor in the testbench module.
